A collection of shell commands and scripts to safely free up disk space on macOS for developers.  
Targets common heavy hitters like **Docker**, **Xcode**, **VS Code**, **npm**, **Multipass**, **Flutter**, and more.

## üöÄ Features
- Prune **Docker images, volumes, and build cache**
- Clear **Xcode DerivedData, Archives, Simulator caches**
- Clean **npm / yarn / pnpm** caches and node_modules
- Reset **Flutter / Gradle / Android SDK** caches
- Purge **Multipass VMs**
- Wipe **VS Code cache & workspaceStorage**
- Remove old **Homebrew** artifacts
- General macOS cache cleanup

## üì¶ Usage
**Clone the repo:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/notKeion/mac-dev-cleanup.git
cd mac-dev-cleanup
```
**Make the script executable:**
```bash 
chmod +x cleanup.sh
```
**Run the cleanup script:**
```bash
./cleanup.sh
```
**Or run with `curl` directly:**
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notKeion/mac-dev-cleanup/main/cleanup.sh | bash
```
## üîé Examples
**Check Docker Usage**
```bash
docker system df -v
```
**Delete old Xcode DerivedData:**
```bash
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*
```

```


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution
- Review the script before running to ensure it fits your needs.
- Some commands may require elevated permissions (`sudo`).
- Always back up important data before performing cleanup operations.
